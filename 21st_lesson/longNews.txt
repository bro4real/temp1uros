Outsourcing

In the perfect world, you can find local resources for your project. But in the USA selecting programming as a profession is not as appealing as it used to be 10 years ago, and you may have to hire an offshore team.
When a budget of the next project is approved, Frank, the manager has to staff it. The budget is small, the leftovers of American programmers are either expensive or just not available. Frank starts looking elsewhere. The largest pool of people who can write if-statements is in India. Of course itís better to have programmers in flesh in the office, butÖno money, no honey.
The major part of software development in Frankís project was outsourced.
The world is round
In a typical US enterprise Jimmyís manager does not fly to India to pick developers for the next project. Heís given the name of one or two consulting companies to choose from, and hopefully, a chance to interview future team members over the phone.
Sure enough, someone from your firm visited India to establish the partnership with one of the major body shops there, which similarly to American ones are made up of 20% good and 80% poor to mediocre programmers. Sure enough, Indiaís IT giants impressed your firmís executive by putting together a well done PowerPoint presentation, showing well equipped offices in a hi-tech building in Bangalore, and applied some other techniques.
Business Times writes about donkeys that complicate morning commute to the work of programmers in India (see
http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_12/b4026001.htm ):
ìWhen foreigners say Bangalore is India's version of Silicon Valley, the high-tech office park called Electronics City is what they're often thinking of. But however much Californians might hate traffic-clogged Route 101, the main drag though the Valley, it has nothing on Hosur Road. This potholed, four-
lane stretch of gritty pavementóthe primary access to Electronics Cityóis pure chaos. Cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, taxis, rickshaws, cows, donkeys, and dogs jostle for every inch of the roadway as horns blare and brakes squeal. Drivers run red lights and jam their vehicles into any available space, paying no mind to pedestrians clustered desperately on median strips like shipwrecked sailors.î
Thomas Friedman, the journalist from New York Times the author of a bestseller ìThe world is flatî was very impressed by visiting Infosys, a large offshore firm in India.Ö
Thomas Friedman has seen all this, but he was very impressed by visiting Infosys offices in Bangalore. They showed him ìa global conference center ñ ground zero of the Indian outsourcing industryí It was a cavernous wood-paneled room that looked like a tiered classroom from an Ivy-League law school. On one end was a massive wall-size screen and overhead there were cameras in the ceiling for teleconferencingî.
Now Mr. Friedman believes that it does not matter where you are, you can work on a global project without leaving your country.
His host named Nilekani, said, ìSo this is our conference room, probably the largest screen in Asia ñ this is forty digital screens [put together] ì Nicekani proudly explained, pointing to the biggest flat screen TV I had ever seen. Infosys, he said can hold a virtual meeting with the key players from its entire global chain for any project at any time on that supersize screenî.
This gets Mr. Friedman excited. Iím wondering though, how a large TV screen can impress a New Yorker? Has he ever been to Times Square located within a two minute walk from the New York Times building?
Several times Thomas exclaims in his book, ìThe world is flat!î, meaning that these days there is no difference which part of the world you are getting services from. No, Thomas, ìThe world is still round!î
A Large screen TV is the last thing that comes to mind of Jimmy-the-programmer, who has to deal with miscommunication and misunderstanding of functional specs and coding assignments and delays caused by time and cultural differences.
In this section Iíll try to explain why outsourcing does not work and why at the same time itís unavoidable. I fully understand that it takes two to tango, and if something does not work out between offshore and US teams, itís the fault of both parties.
In May of 2008, I had a chance to visit India ñ I was invited to speak at a conference in Bangalore. One day Iíll include a new section in this book summarizing my IT discoveries, but meanwhile you can read my raw travel notes in this blog.
I know lots of good programmers from India, Russia and China, but the purpose of the following pages is to show that outsourcing is not as rosy and fluffy as journalists-dilettantes often present. Letís see how it works in a real enterprise IT.
What CIO should know about outsourcing
Jimmyís manager Frank started the meeting by saying that the budget for the new project had been approved, but half of the project will be outsourced to their long time partner from overseas. Can you imagine, their rates for Java programmers can go as low as $20 an hour! We can hire a team leader for $50K a year!
ìNo, we're not losing anyone from our team, and you should take it as an opportunity to work as team leaders, helping our new partners to hit the ground running. No, this wasn't my decision; it came from above".
Three Months Later
Mary, ìI've asked them to add two fields to a JTable on the Invoice screen. The data is being retrieved from our database so they'd need to modify an SQL query as well. I've sent them this e-mail yesterday, but it was night time over there, so they've responded today asking me to send them the modified SQL and write the name of the Java class and method where this new code should reside. I could've done this by myself in two hoursî.
Frank, ìJust be patient, it's a new application for them. By the way, I'd appreciate it if you could stay a little longer today. We're having a meeting with our colleagues from overseas, but there's a time difference, you knowÖ No worries, they're willing to come to work early, so we're starting our meeting at 7pmî.
Six Months Later
Frank, îThe system has to go to UAT in two weeks. We've all worked hard; our remote colleagues put in lots of overtime. John, you're our Java expert, and you've spent the last two weeks doing the code review of that module. Why does it work a little slow?î
Jimmy, ìWell, that module isn't written in Java. I mean, they were using Java syntax, but it wasn't Java programming. There are chunks of unused code fragments, the code isn't object-oriented, they used the wrong Java collections, and there's unnecessary synchronization all over the place. But I can re-write the entire piece in three weeksî.
Frank, ìOK, let's do it - but quietlyî.
After spending many nights in the office, the project was saved. Frank got promoted for delivering the project almost on time and showing "strong leadership in managing cost-saving external resources." But the team's morale went down the drain; two local resources (a. k. a. Jimmy and Mary) got small bonuses and started looking for new jobs.
Post-Mortem Analysis
Unfortunately, more and more CIOs believe that computer programming is a commodity skill that can be bought cheaply when needed and replaced easily like a receptionist, mailman, or any other clerk. They don't believe that having a pool of knowledgeable and talented developers adds any value to the organization.
This wouldn't be the case if the development managers (the Franks) explained to them the price that's paid for the success of such projects. But
most of these managers never do this, because of conflict of interest: Frank's only goal is his smooth movement up the corporate ladder. Moreover, to increase his importance, Frank inflates the resources needed for the project on purpose.

The CIO doesn't have the budget for several additional $70K-a-year developers, so he settles on the same number of $30K developers from overseas with similar r√©sum√©s. Realistically, the "cheap" labor is actually an additional expense on top of the salaries of local employees.
Another hidden expense is the extra time spent writing super-detailed functional specifications and validating the overseas work. Here's one more: for security reasons, you may have to create and maintain a separate encrypted version of your database for the offshore team.
Having said all this, I can't blame the overseas developers. Their countries are experiencing a golden IT rush, so young kids are ready to dive into muddy Java waters after spending several months in vocational school. (If I were in their shoes I'd do the same thing).
They put in long hours trying to learn programming and the business of their rich clients (not to be confused with "fat clients") on the run. As a result of this IT boom, the turnover rate in offshore teams can be as high as 100%. You can often see it just by looking at the source code. Sometimes you get a feeling that a 200-line Java program was written by 10 different people of different qualifications. Forget about naming conventions, design patterns, or any programming style.
Hey, Frank, if you need seven people for a project, have the guts to say seven and not 10. Yes, you won't have a chance to manage an international (or as they like to say global) project, but you'll definitely sleep better at night. Before giving a chunk of your project to a company overseas, talk to your developers and ask them if they really need this help. Your developers are human beings and not just nameless resources.
On the other hand, outsourcing works fine for small businesses because both parties know that the owners of such businesses count their money
and won't pay for poor-quality jobs. It also works when you hire an offshore team of senior people who know the business you're in.
No, their rates aren't cheap, and don't have to be! But such teams usually consist of professionals, who take pride in their work, deliver on time without putting an extra burden on your own developers, and even mentor your staff. This is the outsourcing I vote for, but I'm not the CIO of your company.
Ten tips on dealing with offshore developers
Below is a list of tips for a rookie development manager that has to work with offshore software developers.
1. If your outsourcing partner offers you a pre-staffed offshore team, most likely you are screwed. A typical team in any country (USA included) operates under 80/20 rule ‚Äì only 20% are delivering. Do not accept a team just because it‚Äôs ready. Build the team yourself.
2. Put every candidate through at least the same vigorous interview process as you practice with your local candidates. You‚Äôll be surprised, but some US firms would go easier on the offshore team members just because the team was given to them from above.
3. Do not leave your office until you know what the offshore team will be working on tomorrow.
4. Do not let the local geek manage an offshore team ‚Äì geeks are interested only in cool techniques and coding. They do not really care that spending a week on finding the most elegant solution jeopardizes the project deadlines.
5. Cut the losses quickly ‚Äì if you hired a new offshore member and he did not deliver within the first two weeks, cut him loose. Cutting the umbilical cord sooner saves money (actually a lot of money).
6. Unless you really know the remote developers, use offshore teams for fixed-price projects only. This will allow you to better predict the final cost of the project, and if the project will not be delivered to your specification, you do not have to pay for the poor job. So called ‚ÄúTime and Material‚Äù projects pay per hour or per day. This is a good option if you just want to keep a particular individual around because you know that s/he has good skills, (for example, production support, multiple small projects). Fixed-price projects require more work from your side during the initiation of the project ‚Äì you‚Äôll have to actually take the time and think what you are planning to develop, create a functional specification that reflects the final product. If you made a mistake and want to change your spec down the road, the offshore team can hold you liable and ask for a budget increase or scope reduction.
7. Do not use the same team on the new project just because you‚Äôve worked with these people in the past. Their technical skills may not match your new requirements. Remember, the offshore team is a consulting firm, they are not your employees and you do not have to use them for all new projects.
8. When you give an assignment, make sure that the other side understands exactly what has to be done and by when. You may get the ‚ÄúYes, Sir‚Äù answer, but when the delivery time comes, you‚Äôll realize the other party did not even understand what had to be done. The ‚ÄúYes, Sir‚Äù answer is typical for the Indian culture, where people are used to respect --parents, older people and higher-ups. They tend to avoiding saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. Another scenario is when you give an assignment, the other party decides to do ‚Äúmore‚Äù than you asked for, which leads to increased project scope and missed deadlines. This is what you may expect while working with programmers from the former Soviet Union. Many of them are still writing their own compilers on a regular basis. Time management is an issue there.
9. Make a habit to have a quick 10-min morning conference call with that remote team of telecommuters. (You, on the other hand, can just dream of working remotely. Find out what are their issues. Do not postpone these meeting to the end of the week ‚Äì too much time will be lost.
10. If your outsourced project failed, and you are trying to find who is to blame for it, look in the mirror. Do not blame the offshore team.
Hiring an offshore team is just the beginning and requires extra hard work on your side. Do not just hide your head in the sand ‚Äì the problems will only worsen.

Dead souls from overseas
Here‚Äôs another caveat of managing offshore teams. To make this discussion a bit more interesting, let‚Äôs go back in time into the first half of the 19th century.
The novel ‚ÄúDead Souls‚Äù by the Russian writer Nikolai Gogol was published in 1842. At that time, landowners paid taxes based on the number of people registered with their properties. Often, landowners were taxed even for the dead souls after people would pass away.
Guess what? One entrepreneur named Chichikov started visiting landowners offering to purchase dead souls from them, as this would lower their taxes. Why Chichikov would need to have legal rights to these dead souls? C‚Äômon, it‚Äôs elementary, Watson! He wanted to inflate his importance in the society by showing the large number of souls he owned, so he could take a large loan against them.
By a magic wand, we are back in the 21st century. You are a team leader (a technical guy) on a project that includes both local programmers and an offshore team of Java developers. The boss said that the management has decided to hire a large and well known offshore corporation called Shmata Consulting. Your firm can hire three Shmata‚Äôs programmers for the salary of one American with the same skills.
Things may not be as rosy as they look on paper, but here‚Äôs yet another twist to it. While technical leaders work harder as they need to find a substantial chunk of additional time EACH DAY explaining to the offshore team how to write code and fix errors, the managers of Shmata Consulting do not forget to submit their time shits (did I spell it wrong?) to Frank, the manager for approval. By now, you should be able to guess who these dead souls may be.
Jimmy believes that three programmers from overseas are coding for your project, but Frank might be receiving (and signing) timesheets (yes, this is the correct spelling) of 5 people, and each of these souls were working their dead asses off putting in 80 hours a week. Talk about cheap labor. Talk about Chichikov of the 21st Century. Two centuries ago Mr. Chichikov has founded the Dead Souls Movement, without even realizing how to do these kind of things on a large scale. There was no Internet in Russia circa 1842, so his ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù sound like an innocent joke of a kindergarten boy.

Anyway, what‚Äôs the bottom line? Is there anything you (the tech lead) can do about it? Yes just follow the ten advises from the previous section. These simple rules should prevent your project from being yet another failure with ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù (but still inflated) cost. You may not like this kind of job, but at least you‚Äôll know that you are in better control of live souls, and if some little dead soul sneaks in, kill it again. You can‚Äôt get convicted for a murder of someone who was already dead.
Outsourcing to students
I‚Äôm teaching software programming part time at New York University. While this and other universities offer graduate-level programs with many interesting courses, the situation is different in the undergrad world.
Some schools keep teaching how to multiply matrices in Ada or work with algebraic expressions in Prolog. Half of the courses are preparing
professionals who will be operating on another planet. Information systems programs look a little more down to earth. Meanwhile, many college graduates are having a hard time finding their first jobs because many entry-level programmers jobs are being outsourced overseas, and it'll stay this way as long as it makes financial sense for businesses. Unfortunately, student loans have not been outsourced...
Remember that Catch 22 that so many recent graduates face upon facing the job market ‚Äì can‚Äôt get a job without experience; can‚Äôt get experience without the job?
I have a plan: instead of outsourcing projects to developing countries, businesses should offer them to the local colleges. I'm not talking about simple pilot or proof-of-concept projects; I mean the real ones. This plan requires commitment and the cooperation of academia and businesses. These are some thoughts that come to mind:
ÙÄÇæ
Colleges have to include more classes on software engineering and modern technologies in their undergraduate programs. Here are some of the candidates: Application Servers, Service-Oriented Architecture, Applying Design Patterns, Data Modeling, Business Intelligence, Web 2.0.
ÙÄÇæ
Colleges form teams of programmers starting from the students' junior year. Faculty members lead these teams. Information about these teams (r√©sum√©s, previous projects, GPAs) has to be published on the Internet and be publicly available, and businesses need to publish their project descriptions so student teams can bid on these projects.
ÙÄÇæ
Colleges make their labs, networks, and support personnel available for the teams. If needed, businesses can lease additional hardware to the college for the duration of the project.
ÙÄÇæ
Most of the students study Java programming during their freshman and sophomore years. Many Java components are available for free or through open source licenses: IDE, version control systems, project build tools, bug reporting systems, application servers, etc.
Businesses will purchase any additional required software for a fraction of the cost using heavily discounted academic prices.
ÙÄÇæ
Business managers pick and interview teams for their projects based on the college reputation, available skill sets, location, and other criteria.
ÙÄÇæ
Corporate lawyers prepare a contract with a selected team that defines the obligations of each party, deliverables, cost of development, and potential penalties.
ÙÄÇæ
The turnover rate is usually high on the projects that are outsourced to developing countries, which won't be the case with student teams. On the other hand, there is a risk of not having developers during midterms and final exams. However, since the exam schedules are known in advance, the "freeze time" can be planned accordingly.
ÙÄÇæ
Most of the business managers dealing with developers from other countries complain that cultural differences are a huge problem. Guess what? This won't be a problem if you outsource the project to students who live in the same country and speak your language.
ÙÄÇæ
Even though students will get a minimum salary for this work, they should also earn academic credits and get graded while working on such projects.
The funny (or sad) part is that the students themselves are already outsourcing their college assignments. There are Web sites where you can hire a coder for any assignment in various programming languages. No job is too small. People from around the world can bid on these projects, and since the offered prices go as low as $10 USD per hour. It's clear that only programmers from the developing countries (India, Russia, China, et al) would be interested in these jobs.
Academic outsourcing may be even more damaging than industrial outsourcing, because rich students can improve their grades and earn their degrees without having a good knowledge of their required subjects.
Spending more time working as teams in the labs under the supervision of a faculty member or business manager will help minimize academic cheating.
There is one more secret key to the success of commercial projects developed by students: pizza! Each day the client company can send a couple of pies (half plain and half pepperoni) to the labs where the students work. They are going to work for food...and experience. It's a win-win situation for everybody.
Soviet Programmers
The word "outsourcing" is being associated with India. No wonder -- these guys are street smart, they were raised in a democratic country, they are mobile, know what‚Äôs hot on the market, they speak English and are ready to start working tomorrow anywhere in the world sharing an apartment with five other programmers.
In the USA, all people who speak the Russian language are called Russians regardless if they are Russian, Ukrainian, Jewish, or of any other descent. On the same note, if you are a US citizen, you are American regardless of where your ancestors from. We‚Äôll follow the same convention, even though the proper way to categorize them would by Soviet programmers for all who came to the USA before 1991 and Russian, Ukrainian et al. thereafter.
I used to be one of the Soviet programmers in the 80s. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, society started its painful transition to capitalism. During more than 70 years of dictatorship, people learned the rules of the game, they knew when to keep their mouth shut, how to put scarcely available food on the table, but they lost the spirit of entrepreneurship, which started to change when the Soviet Union ceased to exist.
While Western people were differently-rich, Soviet people were equally-poor. They had pretty much the same income, small but free apartments, good education and OK medicine. Professional emigration from the former USSR was minimal.
All this started to change in early 90th. Now computer professionals who had enough money and wanted to work abroad could do it. While Russians are considered one of the top coders, they are lagging behind Indians in the outsourcing arena. I see several reasons for this:
1. For years, English is the primary language in Indian colleges, while Russians were under impression that sooner or later the rest of the world would learn the Russian language. Also, in the USSR the language of a ‚Äúpotential enemy‚Äù was German, so English as a second language was not too popular. This is changing now, but it takes time.
2. People in India do not think that they are the best nation in the world, while many Russians still do.
3. Many years of dictatorship have encoded the following rule in the minds of most of the Russian population: "There are only two opinions: right and wrong". This was applied to any aspect of lives including computer programming. I remember teaching programming classes for Russian immigrants, and the faces of some of the newly arrived programmers were turning purple should I‚Äôve said something they did not agree with.
4. Some Russians programmers do not trust the programs written by others. They are ready to reinvent the wheel on a daily basis. For example, some of them would rather create their own libraries of reusable objects than use someone else‚Äôs (see item 12 from the humorous post about Russian programmers at http://www.softpanorama.org/Bulletin/Humor/russian_programmers.shtml ).
5. On the other hand, I had and still have the honor of working with extremely bright software engineers from Russia, whose skills are top notch.
Slowly, but surely the situation is changing. Programmers living in Moscow and St. Petersburg earn a lot more than their colleagues in the rest of the country. I do not have official numbers, but based on online posts on Russian Web sites, the annual salary of a mid-level Java programmer is $20-$25K. Senior programmers make $40-$50K. But the skill set of a $50K programmer living in Russia, is comparable to the skill set of a $100K US
programmer (and, adjusting for the cost of living, so are their salaries). Many programmers living in large Russian cities can read English. Speaking skills are improving too.
But the Russian outsourcing model has to be a little different comparing to the Indian one. You can get the best value by dealing with high-end software developers. I know the CEO of one of the most successful Russian IT companies that builds its business not by selling cheap low-level programming to the West, but by focusing on specific business verticals.
They‚Äôve established their own tuition in one of the best universities to attract and "breed" the most talented people. You can‚Äôt hire three of their employees for a salary of one American programmer, but these people are just brilliant.
The United States of America is still one of the leading world economies with high living standards, and it remains a desired destination for people who are not afraid of the challenges of living in a foreign land. On the other hand, the majority of Russian programmers would not leave their country, enjoying modest living standards in familiar environment.
The world‚Äôs leading technology firms feel themselves at home in Russia. IBM is pretty happy there , one of the insiders from Sun Microsystems told me that they consider Russia as one their most important markets (Brazil is also on Sun's radar). To finish with the Soviets, I‚Äôll tell you an one more story - I saw Lenin in September of 2006 in Seattle, WA, USA. Seeing this huge Lenin monument casually standing on one of the streets of Seattle, was a real surprise for me to say the least. People who are as old as Internet may not know who Lenin was, so this is especially for you: would you be surprised to see a 7-ton monument of Fidel Castro standing on the street of New York?

And Pedro said, ‚ÄúMove over, Ravi!‚Äù
What first comes to mind if someone mentions Mexico? Beautiful beaches in Cancun with loaded Margaritas and hardworking people working in the USA in construction, landscaping and other non-attractive jobs. What comes to mind when someone mentions Brazil? Football, Copacabana, and that garota de Ipanema.
I was pleasantly surprised when a friend of mine working for a Fortune 100 firm told me that they used to outsource software development to India, but now they switched to Mexican programmers. Why? Cheaper. Way to go, Mexico! Good for you!
Brazil is yet another emerging supplier of programmers.
But is it right to work with a country just because it offers the cheapest prices? I do not think so. The software development outsourcing may be efficient only if you cherry pick the best of the best as opposed to hiring teams for cheap. Work with individuals, not with teams!
Let's apply the 80/20 rule one more time for an offshore team of five that charges $100 a day for a programmer. The daily offshore payroll is $500.
Such a team needs a local full-time manager here in the US, which earns, say $600 a day. We've got $1100 a day just for the payroll. Four out of five offshore programmers will definitely under-perform to say the least.
The better model is to hire one excellent offshore programmer for $200 a day, which will need two hours a day of the local manager's time (another $200). In this case the daily payroll is $400, and the chances of delivering your project on time will dramatically increase.
This formula won't work if your IT shop is run by a mediocre manager who does not ant to innovate and goes by the flow of the offshore partner given from above.
Visiting an offshore training camp for programmers
I wrote this while sitting in a training camp called Genghis Khan, a school for the rookie offshore programmers. The camp is located in the remote mountains of northern Mongolia. Many wannabe offshore developers come here for training. Since I am a popular personality among the Mongol Java crowd, they let me sit in the class where Baichu, the guru of offshoring was delivering a presentation called ‚ÄúDealing with Overseas Employers 101‚Äù. These are my notes from this class.
1. America is rich, we are poor. It‚Äôs not fair, they have to share.
2. In the beginning, their manager will try to scare you by promising that he‚Äôll check up on the status of your assignments daily. Do not be afraid ‚Äì a status report is just a formality, and they‚Äôll take whatever you write.
3. One of your major problems will be "what to write in status reports". Never write ‚ÄúI could not do it ‚Äù there. Americans like positive statements. For example, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve got an assignment to create a reusable component that will identify the number of failed database requests. You do not even have a clue what are they asking for.
The first week you spend on Google in hopeless attempts to find such a component. The status report for the first week should read ‚ÄúComparing
various approaches of creating reusable db-failures component to find the most efficient and effective way for its development‚Äù. During the second week invent something similar. Hopefully, on the third week something more urgent will come up and you‚Äôll get another assignment.
4. Be prepared to spend the first couple of weeks waiting for the logon id and password to your employer‚Äôs network. After obtaining these credentials, you‚Äôll find out that you still don‚Äôt have access to a dozen of the servers, which require Unix logon. Your remote manager will promise you to resolve it as soon as possible, but because of the service level agreements (a.k.a. SLA) with the Unix support team , you won‚Äôt get access for another week or so. Typically, it‚Äôll take about a month just to get you connected.
5. Never say ‚ÄúI do not know‚Äù. Accept all assignments ‚Äì one of two things will happen ‚Äì either you‚Äôll figure out how to complete the assignment, or it‚Äôll get cancelled.
6. In conversations with your overseas teammates, always require detailed written specifications for each small program modification. Ignore their statements ‚ÄúI‚Äôd fix it myself faster than writing detailed specs for you‚Äù. They have no choice and must work with you to show that your team is useful.
7. Use the time difference to your advantage. For example, if you want to send an email asking for some clarifications, do not send it in the morning, because you may get an immediate answer. Do it in the evening (your time zone), before leaving the office ‚Äì you‚Äôll get the answer next-day.
8. If you have a choice, avoid fixed price projects. Hourly-based pay will allow to put a couple of extra hours here and there, and having a couple of extra tugriks or rubles never hurts.
9. Experienced offshore programmers - usually do not try to obtain US working visas to work onsite. They‚Äôd be working a lot harder in the foreign land. It is not worth the trip.
10. Always be polite ‚Äì it‚Äôll get you far. Insert ‚ÄúExcuse me‚Äù, ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù, ‚ÄúYes sir‚Äù in every other sentence. Always smile - even during phone conversation.
(Then he showed this popular movie about an offshore tech support: http://callcentermovie.com/ .)
11. Change your local employer every three months. You are gaining experience daily, and even if the new job offers just a one percent salary increase, go there. It‚Äôs a golden IT offshoring era ‚Äì use it while it lasts! Or as they say, it's time to make a quick buck!
For some time I was speechless after hearing all these advices. Baichu spent at least half an hour after the class answering specific questions from students. I also asked him, if he really believed in his teachings. He smiled at me and said, ‚ÄúWelcome to the real world, ma‚Äôman!‚Äù
Disclaimer. This did not actually happened in Mongolia, this was just a fruit of my sick imagination - it happen somewhere else.
Lack of management in outsourcing
Some time ago, Information Week Magazine published an article ‚ÄúOutsourcing to Win: 4 steps to An Effective Strategy‚Äù .
They write, ‚ÄúCampbell says most companies lack the necessary management structure to effectively manage a team of outsourcers. With businesses spreading work around to more and more external contractors, they need to elevate vendor management to the executive level and hire the equivalent of a chief sourcing officer, she says. "There are not a lot of individuals within a company that have the multidisciplinary skills required for that sort of role." This is probably the only useful advise that the article gives ‚Äì the rest is the typical gibberish of standard phrases taken out of real world context.
Liz Campbell hit the nail on the head. In my opinion, the lack of management is one of the two MOST IMPORTANT things that make outsourcing fail (I‚Äôll mention the second one a bit later). Of course the roots of this lack of proper management issue lay in the fact that in many cases the project manager has no say in WHO are their outsourcing partners. They are given from above and have roots in golf courses and fancy restaurants.
OK, the project with outsourcing begins, the project managers quickly understand that the low Bangalore hourly rates is a joke, given the fact that because of the typical corporate infrastructure issues (here in the USA), an offshore team of five $20p/h spent two weeks doing nothing but exchanging emails trying to get access to the proper servers. Let‚Äôs do the math: 5*$20*8*10 = $8000. This money just evaporated from the project budget during these two weeks of doing nothing.
Interestingly enough, the upper management will never know about it because‚Ä¶and here comes the second main reason of why outsourcing is much more costly ‚Äì CONSPIRACY. Project managers will cover up such losses because they do not want to disappoint their managers ‚Äì their own yearly reviews and bonuses depend on success of their projects, so they‚Äôll quietly absorb these losses by asking their local team members to work more and tie up loose ends. The local team members have their own reviews too, so they‚Äôll work a bit harder as well.
The article suggests to get familiar with the contract laws and religious adherence to standards. This does not come from the real world.
The next advice of this article is to move to team-based outsourcing projects. I think it‚Äôs dead wrong. The majority of the software developers do not produce much. My advice is to work with the individuals that your team leaders personally pick. Introduce the competition within the offshore firm. Provide PERSONAL incentives for individuals. Some of the offshore teams are sand castles. People there can easily quit their jobs if someone extends them an offer with 2% salary increase.
And if your outsourced project failed, stop blaming Indians ‚Äì just look at the roots of this failure at home.
Me goes to America!
The world is not flat, the quality of life is different in each country. While some people are happy with what they have, and if the economic conditions in their home country turn gray, they complain but try to survive. Other people start looking for better opportunities for themselves and their families elsewhere. They can relocate within the same country going places with better job options, and some people are not afraid to leave their own countries in search of that promise land. One of the most desirable destinations for people of all around the world is the United States of America.
A line by American poet Emma Lazarus describing the Statue of Liberty, appears on a plaque at the base of the statue, which ends with the statue herself speaking:
Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me:
I lift my lamp beside the golden door.
And here I am, knocking at this golden door.
What a country!
A Ukrainian-born U.S. comedian Yakov Smirnoff has a number of jokes that can fall under umbrella ‚ÄúWhat a country!‚Äù I‚Äôm not trying to be funny here, but has my own list of things that were unusual to me in the USA.
I have arrived in the USA in January of 1992 from a grim society, which is now called ‚Äúthe former Soviet Union‚Äù. Sarafanov‚Äôs family gave me a place to stay and the food for free, and I‚Äôll be always grateful for that.
There is a big difference between foreign programmers who live in the USA and those who don‚Äôt. How do I know this? Because I‚Äôve started my career in the USA as a foreign programmer myself! The next several pages are not exactly about programming, but rather about my observation of American lifestyle.
I‚Äôm a USA citizen for many years. I always wanted to live in this country and thought I knew a lot about it, but there were things that seemed unusual during my first years here. This is my list.

My H1B story
I arrived to the USA with good experience in programming. I knew C and C++! Pretty quickly I got an offer, but my prospective employer would hire me only if I‚Äôd have a work permit.
There are several visas that allow you to work in the USA. So-called H1B visa is by far the most popular among software developers ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù coming to America, which is short in enterprise IT talent. Visit a corporate cafeteria in one of the largest American cities, and you‚Äôll get a feeling that you are in India, even you are of Indian descent.
If you‚Äôll take an IT group of ten developers in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and the like, it‚Äôll consist of six Indians, two Chinese, one Russian, and, possibly, one person who‚Äôs first language is English. You may accuse me of profiling, but this book is called ‚Äú‚Ä¶without BS‚Äù, remember? Welcome to the real world! The situation in the mid West is different, but the majority of IT shops are not located there anyway.
At least a half of these people are either still working under H1B visa, or have already received their permanent residency in the USA. The government tries to deal with the shortage of people in different professions, and H1B visa holders can work for six years unless they convert this visa into a permanent residency (a green card) or become US citizens in some other way.
After spending about three months in the USA I passed a technical job interview at a New Jersey company called InterAccess. They liked me and said that now I had to get my visa. I applied with a lawyer and after about three months of living with my fingers crossed, I got it. This is a long process: the prospective employer had to place an advertisement in the local newspapers that they were looking for people with my skills and that they should somehow prove that I was one of the best candidates for this job.
There is something called ‚Äúprevailing wage‚Äù, which means that that employer is supposed to pay me the salary with what is similar to what they pay other people with my qualifications. I do not know what my lawyer did, but if you‚Äôll watch this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCbFEgFajGU it may give you an idea how this process works internally. It‚Äôs not kosher, as most of what lawyers do, but their main goal is to get the job done for their clients.
I got my visa, and my first salary 1992 was $33,000 a year, which back then was a huge amount of money for me and my family who just arrived. I didn‚Äôt have any money at all ‚Äì some cash from delivering pizza. In fact, when my wife and son arrived, I had seven thousand dollars in debt, which I borrowed from friends and relatives. My wife got an H4 visa, which did not allow her to be employed. She started cleaning houses of rich people in Staten Island, NY. During the first eighteen months of my day programming job, I was also delivering pizza on Friday nights and Saturdays.
My long term goal was to became a citizen of this great country, and the first step toward this goal was starting a ‚Äúgreen card process‚Äù that should have been done by my employer. My first employer was a small company and they did not have much experience with green cards, so I found a large consulting firm called Trecom Business Systems that transferred my H1B (this visa allows you to work only for a specific employer). This firm paid me a salary of $45K a year, which was meant a major improvement in my life style. This is the last time I quote my income. Why? I‚Äôll explain this a bit later in the section ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your salary‚Äù.
After six months my new employer applied for the green card and this process took two and a half years. All of these years I have been working hard for this company. I knew that people with my skills were getting better pay, but this didn‚Äôt bother me at all, because I felt that this was a fair deal. I wanted a green card sponsored by my employer, and they wanted my skills for a bargain price. This was a fair game.
In 1996 I became a permanent resident of the USA. My dream came true!
As soon as I got my green card I created a one-man corporation and started to work as an independent consultant. Sorry Trecom, but we‚Äôve been helping each other for three years, and it‚Äôs time to move on.
Are H1B workers abused?
Most of the H1B visa holders are not the people who occupy the leading positions at Google or Microsoft. They usually work for consulting companies, which send them to their clients to work on various projects.
Often (but not always ) these consulting firms pay H1B workers a smaller salary. Today‚Äôs prevailing wage for the H1P Visa candidates is probably about $55,000 a year, which is close to the lower side of the programmer‚Äôs wage range.
If an employer gets a good guy for $55K a year and charges the client $90 per hour, it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that there is a markup there. Sure, consulting companies pocket a big chunk of cash on H1B Visa developers, but as I said above, it‚Äôs a fair game. I‚Äôve been there, but I did not feel abused.
Now let me put on a different hat ‚Äì these days I often hire people. I try to get the best possible person, with the best skills for the amount of money that make sense to our firm. But I also try to find them interesting work. In the beginning, these people don‚Äôt deliver. In the beginning I may need to teach this person a technology that we are interested in at the moment, and I want to keep him on board longer to return our investments in this new hire.
Will this guy stay working for our company? If he is an H1B Visa holder, the chances are a lot higher that this guy will stay working for me for several years then if I‚Äôd hire a green card holder or a US Citizen. You maky not like what I write, but this is a decent deal for both parties for newcomers who want to stay in the country and for employers who want to get the job done and make a profit.
There is a need in H1B software developers, and it‚Äôll just grow. There is a programmer‚Äôs guild (http://www.programmersguild.org/ ) that calls for limiting the amount of these visas given to foreigners. They publish videos and horror stories showing how rotten the system is and the ‚Äúunfair‚Äù things that lawyers do.. There were different attempts by the government to compensate Americans for every foreign worker that they brought into the country. The government forces every employer who is inviting an H1B worker to pay a certain amount of money (I believe it‚Äôs above $5K) to the government for retraining American citizens. I don‚Äôt think that any of these measures will change the overall picture as long as the company that is hiring an H1B workers makes a profit. These hefty fees will not help Americans in retraining unless they really want to get retrained.
No, foreign programmers are not being abused by capitalist sharks. If you are an H1B software developer, do not behave as girls who were brought into the USA with a promise of dancing on Broadway, but now dance on the stages of Go-Go bars. With H1B workers, each party knew the rules of this engagement upfront and is moving toward achieving their goals.
Have I taken your job?
The green card allowed me to work for any employer, and I was on the market as soon as I got it. The IT job market is very competitive. If you are good at what you are doing, you‚Äôll find a better deal. If your skills are a little rusty - sit down and shut up.
Once in a while I run into an article citing people who had lost their jobs and could not find the new ones. These people were born in America and accumulated lots of year of work experience. One of such articles published a story of a guy who was working in IT for thirty five years, and after sending about a hundred r√©sum√©s couldn‚Äôt find a job.
I feel sorry for him, but there are other reasons why such people can‚Äôt find jobs. If you spend thirty five years in the industry, you are over fifty. Of course the age factor plays a role in the search for employment but in the United States enterprise IT industry this is not a showstopper as long as you perform.
I have seen job ads in Russian media, which explicitly state that you have to be under thirty five years of age, which is industrial-strength stupid. As if before thirty five your brain works fine and if you are any older your brain is fried and does not perform. This is absolutely wrong, but is none of my concern since I don‚Äôt live in that country and am not planning to.
In the USA, if you are good software developer your age doesn‚Äôt matter.
The articles with complains don‚Äôt usually mention that people who lost their jobs do not want to move from their home towns because they have roots.
What a BS! If you can‚Äôt provide food for your family, forget about roots, pick up your butt and relocate to the area which has a demand for people like you in two weeks.
Are you moving where the job exists or you‚Äôd rather find several ‚Äúvalid‚Äù reasons why you can‚Äôt go there? If this is the case, do not complain that I took your job. A Free and open market is one of the main values of the USA. Let‚Äôs compete.
There are lots of people who are working under H1B and are ready to rock and roll! They are ready to start working on any project literally tomorrow at any point on Earth. Many software developers from India live in so called guest houses. Their consulting companies are renting an apartment and put there two or three people in a room. They also share a living room, kitchen and bathrooms and are OK with it. They buy inexpensive cars and car pool to work. Technically they can go anywhere they want; they are very mobile.
Don‚Äôt like these intruders? Then build a fence around the country and do not let anyone in, but be prepared to take all these low-paid jobs that programmers from guest houses do. And stop calling yourself a free nation with an open market economy.
These articles don‚Äôt usually reveal that people often just stay in large firms for decades assuming that nothing would ever happen to their employment regardless of competitiveness of their skills. I remember working on a project for a large telecommunications firm. One of their aging programmers was literally doing nothing at work. He had a strange screen saver: large 3-D digits would rotate on the screen showing a different number each day: 254‚Ä¶253‚Ä¶252‚Ä¶
When I asked about the meaning of these numbers, he readily explained that this is how many days left to his retirement, and after working in the same place for more than thirty years, it would be more expensive for the firm to fire him with a large package for doing nothing, than turning a blind eye to his lack of productivity..
I work as a consultant for various corporate clients. Recently, I had to re-engineer an old mainframe-based system to a more modern service-
oriented one. I spoke with software engineers and managers and one of my questions was if they were willing to get retrained and learn new technologies. People were not too keen on doing this. One of them gave me the following answer, ‚ÄùFor this new project we will hire offshore consultants and we‚Äôll manage them‚Äù.
How do you like this attitude? I am happy with what I have, I have this cozy nice little place at work, leave me alone and don‚Äôt tell me to get re-trained. I am fifty years old for crying out loud! I want to manage offshore developers, and I want it now!
They do not realize that the situation may change rather quickly, and these people from overseas may take their jobs and kick them out of their comfy cubicles and offices. If you do not want this to happen, compete with them.
You spent fifteen years in this company? Great, this means that you have excellent knowledge of the business, and this is something that offshore guys don‚Äôt have ‚Äì this is your edge. Keep your technical skills up to date and no one will beat you! Before blaming all these guys from overseas, ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat did I do to secure my job?‚Äù
America is a great country, and who made it great? Immigrants. Even if you were born in this country, your parents were immigrants coming for a better life. By the way, stop complaining about these illegal. Your ancestors came here legally a hundred years ago... just because America was accepting everyone legally back then. It‚Äôs neither yours nor their achievements. Mexicans who are coming to America illegally do so to help their families to survive.
The first generation of immigrants in the US were fighting for survival, they were super achievers. Yes, I‚Äôm a first generation immigrant. I‚Äôll stay focused and will work harder, because I started in this country from scratch being an adult and need to catch up.
I do not know who was the first to make this statement, but it‚Äôs correct. Enterprise software developers create applications for business users ‚Äúto make their lives easier‚Äù. What a clich√©! First, someone decides that there is a need to make the users‚Äô lives easier and finds the money to fund this exiting process. Then, the users need to explain software developers what exactly makes their life difficult. This explanation should be done in a form of functional specification a.k.a. functional spec.
This is when the process of pulling teeth begins. The problem is that often business people can‚Äôt formalize the existing process so we, developers can show them the way to the bright future. The other problem is (especially with legacy applications) that sometimes it‚Äôs not easy to find a person who knows the entire workflow of the application. This person is either quit, retired or died a couple of years ago. The third problem is that business users are busy or want us think they are. We can‚Äôt bother them too much because it distracts them from fulfilling their duties.
If you are a software architect or a team lead you start with asking questions so you can understand what the users think they want from this stupid computer. Then you might even suggest your users conveniences they did not even think of due to lack of understanding of capabilities of these smart computers.
That‚Äôs why having a good interviewer with deep understanding of technology is one of the main ingredients of the success of the project. When the project finally goes live (I‚Äôve yet to see one that goes live on time) , this application is not exactly what the users initially wanted as per that short functional spec. ‚ÄúOh, by the way, can we also squeeze in this little feature?‚Äù
How to select a software vendor for your next project
If you are a development manager of an enterprise IT team, once in a while you‚Äôll have to deal with IT vendors ‚Äì consulting companies that you hire for a specified period of time just to help with a particular project. Our company, Farata Systems is such a vendor company. We consult on various projects for large and small enterprises. At this point you may think that I‚Äôll start bragging about how great we are. On the contrary, I‚Äôll tell you about our failures and the lesson learned.
During the last year our company has lost bids on a couple of consulting projects, and we‚Äôve noticed a pattern there. Here‚Äôs one of these cases.
A large company approached us asking to bid on a large project. We knew how to do the job, we‚Äôve estimated the time and resources and came out with the numbers: $200K over six months. In about two weeks we were notified that they‚Äôve decided to go with a different vendor that offered them to do this job for $60K. We shrugged and moved on with our business.
Six month later, we‚Äôve got a call from them asking if we could help with that project. By that time they paid already $300K to the vendor-winner, and the project was not finished yet.
Since we‚Äôve seen similar scenarios in the past, it seems like a sales pattern ‚Äì some vendors are giving unrealistically low estimates just to get the foot in the door. Then, little by little, they present valid reasons that require additional budget. The client is on the hook because someone‚Äôs career is at stake, and they have no choice but sign the next invoice and keep dragging the project until it either produce at least something that works or comes to a full stop.
A little lie during the job estimates seems to be a trick of the trade of many salesmen across the industry.
When an enterprise IT department gets the budget for a new software development project, they ask several vendors to bid on the project. Some
of them will come up with beautiful PowerPoint presentations on the current state assessment of your system, the future state assessment, and a roadmap to this bright future, which can be fairly technical. More agile vendors hate this BS paperwork - they present you a two-page write-up containing a technical solution addressing your functional specification. The third type of vendors is prevalent, and they will present a decent slide deck and some technical meat.
Then the cost comes into picture. Vendors‚Äô marketing people will estimate the cost of the resources. If you are a newcomer in the enterprise IT, you might not know that ‚Äúresources‚Äù are actually people. Salesmen do not call software developers people, they call them resources. In one of the corporate meetings, I've heard an account manger saying, "A father of one of my resources died so this resource will not be available for a week". Could it get any worse? Actually it could, for example, "An ancestor of one of my resources died so temporarily it won‚Äôt perform its functions".
If a cost estimate of one vendor is substantially lower than others, they are either not telling you the whole truth or will be using dirt cheap resources.
So how you, the development manager can pick the right vendor that will deliver the project in time (or close to the deadline)? Here‚Äôs a solution: give each vendor two weeks and ask them to come back with a working prototype of the system to be developed. Important: you have to pay for this two-week job to each vendor.
I want to make it crystal clear ‚Äì they should come back to you not with a nice-looking diagram of the system, not with the wire frame created with some prototyping tool, but with a working application that is built using the software approved for the project. Of course, this application won‚Äôt be fully functional, it‚Äôll run locally on a laptop with lots of dummy pieces of code, but IT HAS TO WORK.
Say, you have five vendors bidding on your project. The odds are that after such a two-week offer at least two of them will quietly withdraw their proposals. The remaining vendors will present their working prototypes on time and, all of a sudden the job of picking the right vendor becomes easy.
Yes, it‚Äôs cost you a little bit of upfront money, but it was the money well spent.
This was our lesson learned, and now we often offer our perspective client to try us out on this mini two-week project. It‚Äôs fair to our clients, and it‚Äôs fair to us.
What‚Äôs your salary?
In the USA, your salary is the most confidential information. Should you even answer the question about your salary? Never. People who are entitled to know this number already know. Only your boss, HR and, sometimes your spouse know this magic number. There‚Äôs an unwritten law: never ask your colleagues or even friends how much they make. There is another law: do not brag about your salary trying to impress people. There are a several reasons why this is never a good thing to do. Let‚Äôs consider some use cases.
Use Case 1. Joe and Larry are colleagues working for the same company, they have great relations and perform similar duties. After having a couple of beers at the corporate party, Larry says, ‚ÄúJoe, you did a really good job at this tough project with unrealistic deadlines. I hope they‚Äôve compensated you for all these long hours.‚Äù Flattered Joe says, ‚ÄúYes, I got an extra $10K as a bonus‚Äù.
Larry response, ‚ÄúWow, this is really cool‚Äù‚Ä¶and gets upset and pissed off. Two months ago he‚Äôd been working really hard on a similar project, but did not get anything other than ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù. Larry thinks that it‚Äôs unfair. The climate in their team slowly gets worse and Joe and Larry do not go for a beer any longer.

Use case 2. Many years ago Sandy and Max have graduated from the same college. Now they work for different firms but their families have friendly relations and often spend time together. During one of such gatherings, Max asks, ‚ÄúSandy, we are both programmers with similar skills. I‚Äôm thinking of making a move with my career. What‚Äôs the realistic salary I should ask for?‚Äù
And Max makes a big mistake by saying, ‚ÄúWell, you know my skills, and I‚Äôm making $80K working on a time tracking application for our Human Resources department.‚Äù Sandy spent years doing his Ph.D. research and works now on complex algorithms in a lab funded by the government. He makes $60K a year, which is good enough to make ends meet.
After the party, Sandy‚Äôs wife Mary found out about Max‚Äôs eighty grand a year. From that day she could not sleep at night. How come? Max has hardly graduated, while my Sandy was always a genius‚Ä¶Sandy and Mary got divorced in a year.
Use case 3. A firm puts an ad with a job description that fits your profile advertising a salary range $70-$80K a year. Your current salary is $68K, you feel that you are underpaid (even though there is no such a thing as ‚Äúunderpaid‚Äù people) and decided to apply for a job. You meet with an HR person of this company, and they ask about your current salary. You should answer: ‚ÄùI‚Äôm looking for a more challenging job, and the position you‚Äôre
trying to fill is exactly what I want, I‚Äôm qualified for this job, and will be happy to work for you for $80K a year‚Äù.
Do not reveal your current salary. If you need to fill out a job application form, leave this field blank. Most likely you‚Äôll be able get away with this. If not, oh well, look somewhere else. Most likely they won‚Äôt pay you eighty after figuring out that you‚Äôre making sixty eight. This employer knows the qualifications required for this job, they are well aware of prevailing salaries paid for similar jobs by other firms, so their only concern should be if you can do this job and not how much money you made before.
Use case 4. You are looking for a job, and your recruiter sends you to a client company for a job interview. He knows your salary requirements. The potential employer asks you about your salary‚Ä¶ Do whatever it takes but don‚Äôt not answer this question. I do not know who said this first, but it‚Äôs a golden rule of salary negotiations: The first person to mention the number loses Remember, salary is just a part of the compensation package. Here‚Äôs your mantra: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm open for any fair offer. If you decide to hire me, I‚Äôll gladly consider the entire compensation package rather than arguing about the base salary‚Äù. Usually, your agent will be able to negotiate a better deal for you. Let him do his job based on his good relations with this client.
Use case 5. You are a successful software developer, your salary grows faster than average in the nation. You‚Äôve managed to increase your salary from $60K to $120K within the last five years. This is quite an achievement. You feel important and want to teach other people how to manage their careers. Your body was craving for a couple of Wows, and you‚Äôve shared you success story with your neighbor. He said, ‚ÄúWow‚Äù‚Ä¶smiling to himself as he was consistently making $150K during the same period of time. Luckily, your neighbor would never reveal this number. Your self esteem is saved.
Use case 6. Alex and Lisa were going out for two years, and finally Alex decided to propose. By some idiotic rules young men often purchase expensive diamond rings to impress their wife-to-be and her friends. Alex
has purchased a $15K diamond ring, and proposed to her. She was so happy and said, ‚ÄùYes‚Äù. In a couple of months, she asked Alex about his salary. She caught him off guard and he said,‚Äù$60K a year‚Äù. Lisa was a student majoring in accounting. She quickly put two and two together and decided that she couldn‚Äôt live with a man who can spend $15K on a ring having such a modest salary. I do not remember if she has returned the ring though.
Use case 7. Marsha is leading a small team of software developers. Marsha is in her 40s, and she's been with the company for 10 years. Ashish, 27 is one of these sharp god-like gurus who programmed 80% of the project. When Ashish found out that Marsha's salary is $90K and his is only$60K, he decided that it's not fair and immediately started looking for a new job. He did not know that only because of Marsha's connections within the firm was your group given this project in the first place, and because of her Ashish always had the green light when the business analysts input was required. Yes, Marsha was not as good of a coder as Ashish. So? Often team members tend to overestimate their contribution to the success of the project. And you as a project manager better make sure that they do not start comparing their compensations.
Use case 8. Somehow Gordon figured out that Frank is making more money than him. During the annual review, when he found out that his salary will increase only by 4%, he said to his manager, "How come, I am not worse than Frank but he makes more than me".
Yakov, the manager, said that he'd take a look at this situation. In about a month, he invited Gordon in the office and said, "Our department is not doing that great, we've had a series of budget cuts, and even though you are a great asset to our group, I'm going to have to let you go. Sorry, man!" Of course, this was not the real reason: Yakov did not need this bad egg on his team.
Never use someone's salary in negotiations of your raise
You think you are underpaid? Update your resume and hit the job market. Can't do better than now? Sit down and shut up. It's a bit rude, but welcome to the real world.
Americans neither ask nor answer questions about salary. But if you run into a newcomer who may ask you directly ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your salary?‚Äù Just say, ‚ÄùEven my wife does not know this number‚Äù, and give them an American smile.
Underpaid? Quit!
Is there such a thing as underpaid people? The short answer is, ‚ÄùNo‚Äù. Each person is getting paid what s/he deserves at this moment.
You may think that they should pay more for your hard work. I have bad news for you: you are always getting the right compensation.
You feel that you worth more? Hit the road, Jack and see if there is anyone else who also thinks so. Try to find greener pastures.
Let‚Äôs say your current annual salary is $70,000. You just got an annual review and a raise to $74,000. An extra four grand of your gross income translates into twenty seven hundred a year of after tax money $225 a month.
If you are not too happy with this kind of raise, try one of the following two strategies.
Quitting strategy #1. Do not argue with your boss. Just hit the job market. There are two possible outcomes. Outcome number one: you‚Äôll find out that even $74K is way too much for your skills today, and the best offer you can get is $69K. But the negative result is also a useful result. Keep your current job, improve your technical skills to match the market demand. Just sit tight, study to get your technical skills current and six months later try to hit the market again to see if you can get a better offer.
Outcome number two, you‚Äôve got an job offer for $80K. Accept and quit your current job.
Quitting strategy #2. If you believe that you can make more, explain to your boss why you think so. Give her a chance to re-evaluate your compensation. Wait for a couple of months, and if nothing happens, use the quitting strategy #1. If someone makes you a better offer, quit without thinking twice.
The chances are that when you give your two week notice (the industry standard), your current employer will offer you to match or even beat your new deal. And remember the golden rule: don‚Äôt accept a counter offer.
Can't find a better paid job in your town? Move to a different one. Can't or do not want to? Then do not complain - there is no such thing as underpaid people.
Overpaid? Hardly The Information Week magazine has published an article ‚ÄúDown to Business: Is Exec Pay Excessive?‚Äù The author answers, "Hardly". I agree with him because I believe in the open market.
If you are wondering why a policeman earns $50K annual salary while risking his life, the author explains,"...it just means that employers can find more of them at the pay they now earn". Do you think it's fair that a 20 year old basketball player whose vocabulary is "Yo, man" and 500 more words earns ten times more that the President of the USA? I think it's fair because thousands of people are willing to pay big bucks for a game ticket when this Yo-Man is playing. He earns his salary. Big time! Do you think that his agent is overpaid? Hardly. Without his agent this superstar would still be playing in his neighborhood playground on weekends.
Or take the tennis champion Maria Sharapova. Does she earn her pay check? Absolutely! She's pretty and technically she does not even need to play tennis. Maria can just wear these sexy Nike outfits, walk around the tennis court and scream periodically. Trust me, men will keep purchasing tickets.
Do you think that your boss earns too much? I do not think so. Do you think that without you the project would fail? Do not think so. Why your boss is getting paid a lot more without knowing Java or C++ like yourself? You boss has much more responsibility than you do. Your boss is responsible for all the mistakes you make. Your boss wears a Blackberry, and only stupid people can think that this is a privilege. Your boss is on a leash 24x7. Ask yourself, do you think it's going to be better if you get a new boss? Still do not like your boss? Quit, and see if the new one is better.
Do you think that they pay you too much? Hardly. You worth every penny you make today! If someone will pay you more tomorrow, you‚Äôll be worth every penny too. But that is tomorrow‚Ä¶
Poor advice to laid-off people
I like reading blogs. People have opinions and I have opinions. Some of the blogs may change my opinion or two. But this time I ran into a blog that just gives poor (IMO or IMHO) advice on things that a person has to do on the first day after being laid off. At this point, kindly switch to Jason Kester‚Äôs blog and read it. Done? My turn.
Being laid off is one of the most serious cataclysms in anyone‚Äôs life. Stronger that this could be moving to a new house (been there) and American divorce (no practical experience here, just the horror stories from people who went through it).
If any person will tell you ‚ÄúI was laid off, but received good severance package. So I do not really care‚Äù, s/he lies to you. S/he‚Äôs very upset. Everyone should be upset receiving a sudden punch in the face.
Jason suggests to book a flight and see the world because ‚Äúyou will never have a better chance to see the world than right now‚Äù. I love travel, but I prefer to do so when it‚Äôs convenient for me, and not because someone kicked me out of the house as an Indian cow that stopped producing milk. It‚Äôs kind of weird analogy, but I just came back from India , and I went there not because of being laid off.
Then, Jason makes another cute statement, ‚ÄúYou have a pile of savings and a severance package‚Äù. My sincere congratulations to the author, but I can tell you a little secret, most people (in the USA) neither have a pile not a package. The only thing they have is a burning painful thought, ‚ÄúHow long can I last till they kick me out of the house‚Äù. Because these days American dream has converged from having a house to making money for a down payment to a house.
One more gem, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got 6 months to a year before your skills start getting rusty‚Äù. If they are not rusty, why not getting another job, and see the world when it‚Äôs going to be your choice, not their?
Moving along‚Ä¶Jason recommends to fly to Thailand, and this is not a bad idea, if you go there when the sun is bright and the grass is green, which is not the case on the first day after the layoff. Contradicting to himself (remember the pile of cash?), the author states that Europe is crazy expensive, and you may even consider going to South Africa, where you get a room for $0.75. After years and years of travels, I‚Äôve learned one thing: hotels cost pretty much the same everywhere in the world if you‚Äôll compare apples to apples. Go online, take any hotel chain you like: Hilton, Sheraton, Four Seasons and pick any country in the world. You may be surprised to learn that the prices are the same.
Of course, college kids happily travel in Europe staying in Paris hostels for $10 a bed. But there is a big difference between the state of mind of happy campers whose main goal is to quickly get drunk and get laid (without off) with a different person each day, and a laid off guy/gal with a little pile in their hands.
Then Jason starts bragging, ‚ÄúDid I mention that I take about 9 months vacation a year‚Äù. Congratulation again, but the rest of the world are just not like that. Poor thing, he ‚Äústart missing work after about six month away‚Äù. I feel for him. Staying in $.75 rooms for six months in a row must be worse than being an inmate in one of the American prisons. Jason reveals that he spends $1000 a month staying away from developed countries. Thirty five bucks won‚Äôt get you far, but you may try one of the Frommers guides like Scandinavia on 40 Dollars a Day ( get it for a penny at Amazon ) . Oops, it‚Äôs been published in 1987‚Ä¶Sorry. With today‚Äôs weak dollar, even Rachel Ray stopped telling her stories about $40-a-day travel and switched to a safer 30-min meals show.
To keep your skills up to date, you should take your laptop with you. I wonder if these $.75 rooms offer safe deposit boxes that can accommodate your laptop while you are out enjoying $3 lunch?
I can keep commenting, but the bottom line, that blog gives a BS advice. Hopefully this book will help you to manage your career and be ready for layoffs, which suck. Really.
Is life in startups any different than in corporations?
Vacations are meant for reading. This time I‚Äôve picked an e-book ‚ÄúEric Sink on the Business of Software‚Äù. This section is not a review of this good book, but rather my own thoughts and comments inspired by reading what Eric thinks about running a small software development company.
Below are some quotes from Eric‚Äôs book with my comments
ÙÄÇæ
‚ÄúI like the smell of a freshly killed bug.‚Äù Very well said. I‚Äôd take it one step further and submit to Wikipedia the following definition of a geek: ‚ÄúSoftware geeks are people with a smell disorder. Most of all they love the smell of a freshly killed bug‚Äù.
ÙÄÇæ
‚ÄúGood communication is not 50% listening and 50% talking, It‚Äôs more like 80% listening and 20% talking‚Äù. It‚Äôs very true. Can you listen to someone other than your boss or wife without interrupting for more than three minutes? If yes, you have good communication skills.
ÙÄÇæ
‚ÄúYour ideas are worthless‚Äù. Exactly! This is long and winding road between your great idea and a PRODUCTION QUALITY software product.
ÙÄÇæ
‚ÄúThe purpose of 1.0 is to help pay for the development of 2.0‚Äù. This means that you should not try to put too many features into the first release of your product ‚Äì get it out the door and start making some money.
Eric‚Äôs message about not using your house as collateral for your business is not strong enough. My message is this: ‚ÄúDo not even think about it!‚Äù
One day you came home telling your wife, husband, or a domestic partner that you‚Äôve got an idea about developing a software product that will change your life and make you rich. But to implement this idea, you need some cash ‚Äì let‚Äôs take a second mortgage to get this cash from our house.
The only proper reaction from your wife, husband or a domestic partner is showing you a middle finger.
No, there can‚Äôt be any special circumstances that would justify a chance to lose your house, if you made a mistake. If this idea is that great, why don‚Äôt you try to convince anyone other than your wife, husband or a domestic partner to shell out some cash for implementing it? It‚Äôs not easy? I know. But maybe this means that your idea is not that great?
Fine, if you still believe that this software product is your future, go ahead ‚Äì start spending extra 5-6 hours daily (after your day paying job) developing your product, or get a second job if you need to hire a software developer.
I had and still have lots of ideas, but over the years I came up with the following cold-shower technique. Let‚Äôs say, you have an idea of THE software product. Assume that you‚Äôve already created it. Fast forward the time machine and visualize the day when you‚Äôve completed development of your one-of-a-kind-state-of-the-art software program. Congratulations, but what‚Äôs next? What are you going to do with it? Can you sell it to at least one person? Price does not matter. Can you make anyone pay even $10 for your creation? How are you planning to advertise it? Do you have even a slightest idea about marketing of your product? Do you have the budget for marketing? Your Web page explaining the revolutionary effect of using your newborn baby will go unnoticed unless you will be constantly promoting it.
Eric‚Äôs book is about creating a small Independent Software Vendor (ISV) company that creates profitable software. He mentions that there are companies that do both ‚Äì develop software and offer consulting services, and this is how his company has started.
I‚Äôm also partner in a company that does exactly this ‚Äì we develop software components and offer consulting and training services as well. This business model allows us not to carry all our eggs in the same basket. This model has the following advantages over a product-only ISV:
1. Having two sources of income (consulting and product sales) is better than one. This is a no-brainer.
2. Both of these business activities complement each other dearly:
a) the money earned by consulting or training gigs can be used for the development of a software product. Such internal investment is a lot more attractive than asking for venture capital (VC) elsewhere.
b) it‚Äôs a lot easier to get consulting gigs if you are also an ISV. The fact that you can develop advanced software adds a lot of credibility to your consulting services. This really helps us to stand out from other consulting body shops that bid on the same project.
3. If our software product sales won‚Äôt be as good as predicted, we won‚Äôt need to turn off the light in our business. Armed with the knowledge gained during product development our technical skills (so needed in the consulting business) are always up to date, and it‚Äôs pretty easy to demonstrate.
Startups may have different problems than larger corporations. Employees in startups often work harder and have to wear multiple hats during a day, their compensation is lower and the dreams of capitalizing on a product they develop comes true for only a tiny number of ISVs. But hey, you never know‚Ä¶Maybe the startup you work for will become the next Youtube or Facebook.
A small ISV just can‚Äôt afford hiring the wrong people (both employees and contractors). Wrong people are the ones that are either not technical enough or do not have proper communication skills. For example, we‚Äôve had a technically sound worker who did not like answering emails. After several attempts to get the status of his assignment, we had to fire the guy. A larger firm would never do something like this, but a small ISV just can‚Äôt afford to have such a person. Yes, it‚Äôs a pity that we‚Äôve invested some time into this worker, but we can‚Äôt make success of our company dependent on the mood of one programmer (even if he‚Äôs has good technical skills).
We had to let go of another person after about two months of employment ‚Äì he was not good enough technically. Hiring this guy was a mistake in the first place, we‚Äôve lost several thousands of dollars on him, but we must cut our losses quickly, learn from our mistakes and move on. Large corporations have lots of dead wood, which burns large chunks of their profits. Small ISVs should not tolerate this.
Eric does a good job explaining the difference between programmers and software developers, and he makes a very important statement, ‚Äúa small ISV should not have any programmers‚Äù. This statement might sound strange, but it‚Äôs not if you realize that programmers are the people who just write code and do nothing else. Not to be confused with people called software developers, which do many other things like talking to users, making decision, perform testing and ARE CREATIVE.
Our small ISV company has people working in different countries, which makes having programmers (not developers) even a bigger no-no. Unless you can afford writing crystal clear specs for programmers, which small ISV can‚Äôt, having programmers is expensive even if you pay them relatively modest salaries. They may not understand (and care) why they were asked to write this piece of code.
The time difference adds to the problem: you give them an assignment TODAY, and TOMORROW they respond that they did not understand it. It‚Äôs a bummer. You‚Äôve lost a day, which may affect your deadlines, and the salary paid to this person for yesterday‚Äôs work was paid for nothing.
My short vacation was over, and I‚Äôve completed half of Eric‚Äôs book. I like the book, and may finish it one day. But I will follow his own advice ‚Äì do not read one book on the business of software ‚Äì read ten.
Why people work overtime
It‚Äôs 7PM, and you can hear from your cube that people are still typing. Why they do not go home? Are they forced to stay late? Are they getting paid for these long hours? Why?
First, let‚Äôs briefly touch upon the small startup culture ‚Äì these people have some "idea", and who knows may be their little company will become the next Youtube or Facebook. These shops are either self-funded or operate under the scrutiny of VC. So when you hear that a company XYZ received $10M in venture capital funding, this does not mean that anyone in this company became richer.
This means that they earned the right to continue working on this idea/product envisioned by the founders of the company. People in startups work long hours, wear multiple hats, and hope that N number of options they have worth nothing today will turn into a fortune some day. Welcome to California! The startup spirit lives there. People think not just salaries, they think options (shares). If I‚Äôll just stay for two years with this company, I might exercise some portion of my options. This is the Silicon Valley‚Äôs way of getting good software developers working long hours for sub-standard wages. Let‚Äôs leave this group of people alone and wish them good luck. I understand their motives.
The East Coast is different. Unless you are in Boston, you don‚Äôt know much about startups and options, and just work for one of the larger enterprises. We‚Äôve already covered two ways of earning income: working as an employee or a contractor .
Contactors work for money. Period. If someone tells you ‚ÄúI prefer working as a contractor because it gives me more freedom‚Äù, this is BS unless there are some special circumstances (i.e. you‚Äôve enrolled in a PhD program or can work only a small number of hours per week).
Since contractors work for money, they like working overtime and they are getting paid for these hours. Some employers try to save a little bit and insert a clause in the contractor agreement stating that a contractor works a professional day at so-and-so hourly rate. Some smarty pants from HR came with this idea called ‚Äúprofessional day‚Äù, which means that the regular 8-hour day may be occasionally stretched to ten hours . If you‚Äôve signed the contract that pays $80 p/h and on Wednesday need to work for 11 hours, you are getting 8x$80 plus another $80 for the eleventh hour, which is considered overtime.
Contractors have very simple and healthy relations with their clients. You need me for six months? No problem - $80p/h. You need me for two weeks? No problem. $100p/h. Why is it getting a lot more expensive? Because employers must pay for the convenience of having a skilled worker just when they need him on a very short notice and for a short assignment. You click on the button, and Joe is here. Seasoned employers understand that Joe-the-contractor will have some non-billable time after these two weeks and this higher rate should make up for the lost earnings. Besides, hiring a full time employee is like getting married, the wedding is expensive (you pay the recruiting agency hefty finder‚Äôs fees) and divorce is getting even more expensive. Let‚Äôs leave this group alone. I understand their motives.
Moving to the most complex case ‚Äì full time employees working overtime. Let‚Äôs single out the managers ‚Äì these people are there to make careers, and they have to work long hours. These endless meetings steal their time and they have to stay late to get anything accomplished. Their higher-level incompetent managers give them unrealistic deadlines, and, if they are incompetent themselves, they just pass the pressure to their software developers, business analysts and testers, which start staying late once in a while. This is fine as long as it‚Äôs happening once in a while. But all of a sudden, you found yourself working 10-12 hours every day without getting paid even for one extra hour.
Why people do this? I see several reasons:
1. Your technical skills are not up to date and you are afraid of losing this job, especially if you have no discipline in spending. Why did you purchase that car that you could not afford? Did you really need that apartment in Miami with zero down?
2. You are promised B-O-N-U-S at the end of the year, and if you won‚Äôt be nice, you r B-O-N-U-S will become even smaller. October and November are the most important months for making bonus decisions, so you better behave. When you get this bonus, do a simple exercise: Add your salary and bonus and divide it by actual number of hours you‚Äôve spent in your cubicle. You may be surprised by the results!
3. You are a workaholic and just like to work.
4. You have family issues and would rather stay at work than go home.
5. Your company pays for your college, and you have to show your appreciation by working overtime.
6. You are a smart kid, and working overtime gives you a chance to better learn the business you are in and improve your technical skills. You are planning to move.
7. Your technical skills are very poor, and staying overtime is the only chance to get even simple assignments done.
8. You or someone in your family have a disease and you need to have good medical insurance and changing jobs is not an option.
9. You need to have daily meetings with your offshore team in India, and because of the time difference you have to start working at five in the morning. Leaving from work earlier than your boss is not an option, so you routinely put extra hours.
The bottom line: be good at what you are doing, and then you won‚Äôt need to say ‚ÄúYes, Sir‚Äù every time when your manager decides that you are a second-class citizen and your main goal is to support his/her career promotion.
If you are good at what you are doing, you are allowed to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and still keep the job. Pretty simple recipe, isn‚Äôt it? You‚Äôd better put these extra hours taking some extra classes in your local college or self-study. You do not need to change your profession.
Do the same things as other people do, just do them a little better.
SOA, RIA and the Human factor
This section of the book is a little bit more technical then the others, but it delivers a message about important motivations for implementing any new technology in the enterprise. While making a presentation on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) I've asked the audience the following question, ‚ÄúWhat do you think is the driving force for implementing any technology or architecture in a decent size Enterprise?‚Äù
The answers were typical ‚Äì better code re-usability, accessibility‚Ä¶ But I was looking for a different answer that has nothing to with technical merits of any technology. Based on what I see in the real world enterprises, the main reason of implementing SOA or any other IT initiative are career goal of individuals working in this organization.
People want to become more visible and move up the career ladder. Implementing SOA across organization can make enough noise to move them to the next level.
SOA Ground Up
The SOA in your firm can evolve from the ground up. For example, an ambitious architect attends conferences, goes through training, reads white papers, and now he truly believes that SOA is the right way to go. He‚Äôs aggressive and influential and manages to convince the CTO or CIO to allocate funds for this.
If you are not an architect but just a software engineer, you may try to start convincing your application manager, but an average application manager
does not want SOA. He‚Äôs busy with business as usual: do not forget to call into the change management meeting, fix yesterday‚Äôs production bug, deal with an offshore team, attend 5-6 meetings a day‚Ä¶ An enterprise IT manager is a firefighter. Imagine a firefighter that is putting out a fire‚Ä¶Here you come in a clean white suit offering to sell some new bells and whistles for a fire truck‚Ä¶
